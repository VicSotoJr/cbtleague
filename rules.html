  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <div class="content">
      <p style="color: white;">Hey guys. Welcome to the CBT League. There are a few things I
        want to go over with each and every team. I will do my best to make
        sure this league runs smoothly and no issues happen but it’s your
        responsibility to follow these rules so we can meet each other half
        way. If you have any questions about anything, please reach out to
        me.</p>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>First rule:</u> Please arrive to games on time. (mandatory). There will
          be a 15 min grace period but the games will start approximately at
          6:15, 7:15, and 8:15 if we have enough to start the game. The team
          present gets an automatic win. The refs will leave if you don’t show
          up on time.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Second rule:</u> This is a no NONSENSE league. I am more than fair
          but if you and your team become disrespectful to the staff or to other
          opponents, then the police will be called ASAP. The league will not
          tolerate any bullshit.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Third rule:</u> You’re only allowed in the gym. If you have to use the
          bathroom outside the gym you can but don’t wander around the
          halls. This is a middle school & it was very, very hard to get this
          gym for this adult men’s league so don’t ruin it for everyone else.
          Please!</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Fourth rule:</u> Don’t give refs a hard time. I get the games will be
          intense but don’t be disrespectful and want to fight or threaten the
          refs. That’s an automatic disqualification from the league (No
          Exceptions).</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Fifth rule:</u> You must wear your CBT jersey every game. This is
          mandatory. If you don’t, your team will receive a TECHNICAL
          FOUL for each player that does not have their jersey. Read this rule
          again.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Sixth rule:</u> Individuals must play in a minimum 4 games to qualify
          for playoffs.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Seventh rule:</u> Rosters will be locked Week 3. That means you can
          not add anyone new to the team.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Eighth rule:</u> Everyone must sign a waiver to play in this league.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Ninth rule:</u> No weapons!!! I shouldn’t even have to say this but you
          don’t know anybody more. Keep the peace!!!</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Tenth rule:</u> Another reminder, this a no nonsense league. If you
          continue to be be a problem, you will be kicked out of the league
          without getting your money back. I’m very, very serious. Don’t ruin
          it for everyone else.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Eleventh rule:</u> If you text or call me that your team has to forfeit the game, then that’s an automatic Loss. No turning back. </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Twelfth rule:</u> No hanging on rim at all before and during the game. </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Thirteenth rule:</u> Nobody is allowed to be near the scores table complaining about stats. </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Fourteenth rule:</u> Each game has a 10 min running clock even on free throws. Last 2 mins in the 4th the clock will stop.  </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p style="color: white;"><u>Fifteenth rule:</u> 4th quarter clock will run after made shot under 2 mins. It only stops for dead balls, timeouts and free throws.  </p>
      </ul>
      <p style="color: white;">
        *We’ll be cracking down on Technical fouls moving forward. Any swearing at refs or threatening refs will be an
        automatic technical foul.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">
        *2 techs the same game will result in being removed from the game.
      </p>
      <p style="color: white;">
        *If you don’t leave the court after we tell you multiple times your team will get a team technical foul again &
        you will be removed from the league immediately for disrupting the league. </p>
        <br>
      <p style="color: white;">*A technical foul would count towards the players foul & the teams
        foul.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">*Timeouts: Each team will be awarded two timeouts per half. The
        timeouts do not carry over.</p>
      <p style="color: white;">*Spectators can come and watch the games but we will not be
        allowing people to argue with the refs and threatening them or the
        other team. You will be asked to leave and if you don’t leave we will
        be calling the police. </p>
